# Word-jump mode (`s`)

Word-jump lets you move the cursor to any visible text position in two or three
keystrokes: press `s`, type enough characters to identify the target, then press
the label that appears on it.

---

## Quick reference

| Step | What you do | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `s` | Enter jump mode | Footer shows `jump: type to search…` |
| type chars | Narrow matches | Matches highlight; labels appear when count ≤ pool |
| press label | Jump | Cursor moves to match start; Normal mode restored |
| `Backspace` | Remove last char | Matches recomputed |
| `Esc` | Cancel | Return to Normal; cursor unchanged |

## Matching

Matches are found **case-insensitively** across all **visible lines** (the
current viewport, not the full scrollback). Every position where the typed
string appears — as a substring, not necessarily at a word boundary — is a
candidate.

### Trailing-space matching

If the typed string ends with a space (e.g. `"foo "`), each line gets virtual
trailing spaces appended before matching. This lets you match `"foo"` at the end
of a line by typing `"foo "` — useful for targeting a word that is the last
token on the line rather than a prefix of a longer word.

The label is clamped to the last real character of the line so it never renders
past the line end.

## Label states

As you type, the UI cycles through three states depending on how many matches
exist and whether the label pool is large enough to cover them.

### State 1 — too many matches (partial highlight)

When the number of matches exceeds the available label pool, **no labels are
assigned** but every match is still highlighted. This gives you visual
confirmation that the search is working and shows you where to look as you
refine the query.

- All matched characters render in `jump_partial_fg` (default: yellow `#eed49f`)
- Footer shows: `jump: <query>  (N matches, keep typing…)`

Type more characters to narrow toward state 2.

### State 2 — labels assigned

When match count fits within the label pool, each match gets a unique label
character overlaid on its last matched character.

- The label glyph renders with `jump_label_bg` / `jump_label_fg` (peach on base)
- Any matched characters **before** the label render in `jump_match_fg` (red)
- Footer shows: `jump: <query>  (N matches)`

Press the label character to jump, or keep typing to narrow further.

### State 3 — no matches

When the typed string has no matches in the visible viewport, nothing is
highlighted.

- Footer shows: `jump: <query>  (no matches)`

## Label assignment

Labels are not assigned randomly. The algorithm applies several rules in order
to make label characters predictable and non-conflicting.

### Distance-first ordering

Matches are sorted by distance from the cursor before labels are assigned.
Distance is measured as `line_distance × 10 000 + col_distance`, so vertical
proximity dominates. The nearest match gets the first (alphabetically earliest)
label from the pool.

### Typed-char exclusion

Characters already typed are excluded from the label pool (both cases). This
prevents a label from intercepting a character the user might still want to type
to narrow the search.

Example: typed `wo` → `w` and `W` and `o` and `O` are never labels.

### Continuation-aware exclusion

This is the most important rule. For each match, the plugin looks at the
character **immediately after** the typed prefix in the source text — the
"continuation character". Two sub-rules apply:

**Ambiguous continuation (count ≥ 2):** if the same next character appears after
the typed prefix in two or more matches, that character is excluded from the
label pool entirely. Typing it will always narrow the search, never commit a
jump to the wrong position.

```
text:   word   worm   woa
typed:  wo

'r' is the next char for both "word" and "worm" → 'r' excluded
'a' is the next char for only "woa"              → 'a' may be a label
```

**Unique continuation (count = 1):** if a character is the next char for exactly
one match, it is **pre-assigned** as that match's label. It is simultaneously
removed from the general pool so it cannot accidentally land on any other match.

```
text:   wor   woa   won
typed:  wo

'r' → unique for "wor"   → pre-assigned label r on "wor"
'a' → unique for "woa"   → pre-assigned label a on "woa"
'n' → unique for "won"   → pre-assigned label n on "won"
```

Pressing `r` jumps directly to `wor`, not to whichever match happened to be
nearest the cursor.

**Matches with no continuation** (match sits at the end of a line) receive a
label from the general pool like any other unresolved match.

### Why this matters

Without these rules, pressing a label could jump to one word while the same
character would have narrowed the search to a different word if used as a prefix
character. The continuation rules guarantee that:

> The next character after the typed prefix is always safe to type — it either
> selects the target directly (unique continuation, pre-assigned label) or
> narrows the search further (ambiguous continuation, excluded from labels).
> It will never commit a jump to an unintended position.

## Rendering priority

When multiple visual elements overlap on the same character cell, the highest-
priority element wins:

| Priority | Element | Style |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Jump label glyph | `jump_label_bg` bg + `jump_label_fg` fg + bold |
| 2 | Labeled-match prefix chars | `jump_match_fg` fg + bold |
| 3 | Partial-match chars | `jump_partial_fg` fg + bold |
| 4 | Cursor cell | Inverted |
| 5 | Current search match | `search_current_bg` bg |
| 6 | Selection range | `sel_bg` bg |
| 7 | Normal text | Default |

Labels are always visible even if they overlap with the cursor or a selection.

---

## Interaction with selection mode

If a selection anchor is set when you enter jump mode, the jump **extends the
selection** rather than moving the cursor freely. The anchor stays fixed; the
cursor (and therefore the selection endpoint) moves to the jump target. This
lets you select a range entirely by keyboard:

1. Position cursor at one end of the desired range
2. `Space` to set anchor
3. `s` → type → press label to set the other end
4. `Enter` to copy or `Shift-Enter` to insert

---

## Label pool size

The default pool is the 52-character string `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`.
After excluding typed characters and all continuation characters, the effective
pool shrinks. If the remaining pool is smaller than the number of unresolved
matches, the UI falls back to partial highlighting (state 1) until you type
more.

You can make the pool smaller (and therefore reach labeled state faster with
fewer matches) by restricting the `labels` config key:

```kdl
labels "asdfjkl;"   // 8 home-row chars — snappy but needs longer queries
```

See [`configuration.md`](configuration.md) for the full config reference.
